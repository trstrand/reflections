When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others, or if you are wanting to share your code, you can push your repository to github.com.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling manually means you, as the developer, can decide what code changes you want locally versus on the remote. Automatic updating could lead to issues with unwanted code ending up where you dont want it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branching a repository allows for changes to the code that does NOT affect the master branch (until merge)
    Cloning a repository allows you to make a copy of the code into a new separate repository
    Forking a repository on GitHub allows you to make a copy of a repository, linking it to the original, and cloning it onto your GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a local copy of the remote allows for work to be done offline
    It also allows the full repository to live locally
    Using fetch, merge, pull will allow updating the remote
